# Robotics-Assessments
Collection of code used in assessments for UCL Robotics and Computation Masters

* Robotic Systems Engineering: Multiple works involving hardware interfacing, simulations, and ROS. Work on DH parameters, forward and inverse kinematics, and path planning. Requires several packages including RVIZ to run but the code should be largely human-readable.

* Robotic Control Theory and Systems: A quadcopter control coursework, demonstrating control theory and especially PID control. Demonstrations referred to in the report can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nw6laluQAYsvmWQawBPEHDX4LSv5z59t?usp=sharing

* Acquisition and Processing of 3D Geometry: A semi-novel research project looking at calculating geodesic distances using a heat-flow method.
